This is a GTK port of the Mac OS X version of 
Gitnub (http://github.com/Caged/gitnub/tree/master)

Bear with me, this is the first release and my first time 
doing anything with RubyGTK that extends beyond hello world.

* NOTICE *
Mozembed crashes when loading large commits. Try not to load 
your initial commit for right now. I am looking into how to 
fix this
